# Portfolio Website Process
Welcome to my portfolio site where I spent countless hours and struggled to create a working website.
The slowest part for me was finding how to start, its what frustrated me the most as i put in so much time and scraped so many ideas and when I finally got to a point where I was happy, I still felt like I wasted a ton of time.
The only struggle after that was setting up the grids as its a concept I still struggle with.
To help with that, I borrowed grid code from Emily McMahon as her grid set up was very similar to what I had envisioned with my portfolio site.
Styling everything else went smoothly with no issues, it felt relaxing actually, probaly the most enjoyable part of this since i felt so stress free since the difficult parts were over with.
I got a lot of good feedback from the survey, one or two comments mentioned my portfolio images which i adjusted to show them off better.
